      <h1><s>Gib Address</s></h1>
      <p>We're done collecting addresses. This webpage was to collect contact info for sending out wedding invites for Rico & Vulan.<p>
      <h3>Change of plans</h3>
      <p>We (Vulan and myself, Rico) had originally planned to send out wedding invites by now for a <strong>Octotber 15, 2020</strong> date. However, thanks to COVID-19, We have decided to postpone the wedding.</p>
      <p>I am holding onto your contact info for when we do decide on a new date, we can send you an invite.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Other concerns:</h2>
      <h4>ASAfDSAFSD! My address is different!</h4>
      <p>Several people brought this our attention. I'll likely be confirming all physical addresses before sending anything. :)</p>
      <h4>I didnt give you my info yet!</h4>
      <p>If you didnt fill out this form (when it was live), thats okay. Either we already know you well enough to hand deliver you an invite, or we took your information down offline (as per secuirty concerns).</p>
      <h4>Data Security</h4>
      <p>Your contact info has been offloaded from my webserver so its not setting out on the internet. The database table was already encrypted and protected, however, since the internet is unpredictable, all that information was removed from the online server and is now kept locally off the internet (Still encrypted). If there is a strong concern of the security of your data (Name, Address, and/or email), please let me know and I will remove the record.</p>
